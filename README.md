# Reboot Router 

Reboots the DD-WRT router when there are no WiFi clients connected to it.

## Background 

My router would occasionally disconnect any of the wireless clients that were connected to it. Since 
I have wired and wireless devices connected, some of the time I would not know that the wifi had 
stopped working until my phone or laptop wouldn't connect or I noticed that a automation did not 
trigger when it should have. 

## Solution 

After updating to the latest DD-WRT firmware, the problem persisted.  Given that I work building
automations to improve business processes, I decided that I would build and automation that would 
connect to the routerâ€™s web interface and see if there are any wireless clients connected to it.  
If there are no connected wireless clients, then there is a great chance that the wifi process that 
authenticates clients has crashed.  As a result, the process would need to be restarted and the easiest way
to restart the process would be to reboot the router. 

## The Technology 
This solution uses Selenium Webdriver to connect to the DD-WRT router web interface. I built this using
.NET Core, but it could be done on Python, Java, or one of the other platforms that Webdriver works on. 
I also set up a cron job that calls this process to perform the automated task.  The cron job is set to run every 
20 minutes.  I have it set up on server that is always running.
